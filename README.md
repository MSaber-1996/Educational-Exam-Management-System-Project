Educational Exam Management System

Tools Used: 
Python (Tkinter), SSIS, SQL, Power BI

Project Overview:

The objective of this project was to develop a comprehensive desktop application for managing student exams and visualizing academic performance.
This application was built using the Python Tkinter library and integrated various data processing and visualization tools to enhance its functionality and usability.

Key Features and Methodology:

o Desktop Application Development (Python Tkinter): Developed a user-friendly desktop application that allows students to take exams in a secure and controlled environment. 
The application also provides functionalities for instructors to create, modify, and correct exams easily.
o Data Integration and Transformation (SQL Server Integration Services): Utilized SSIS to collect data from various sources, transform it as needed, and ensure it was ready for analysis. 
This involved handling different data formats and applying necessary transformations to maintain data integrity and quality.
o Database Management (SQL Stored procedure): Created stored procedures to insert and manage new data entries. 
The procedures were designed to handle real student data, adhering to specific conditions and formats to ensure accuracy and consistency.
o Data Visualization (Power BI): Leveraged Power BI to create interactive and insightful dashboards. 
These dashboards provided a comprehensive view of academic performance, showcasing the number of students in different subjects, 
the exams they passed, their grades, and their rankings based on grades.
